<br><b>Outline Warehouse App</b><br><br>
SEMV company has a robust system that efficiently manages all corporation operations. However, warehouse specialists and the warehouse manager face challenges due to their workspace limitations and the nature of their roles. Managing goods and warehouse operations solely from a computer is impractical for them, especially since they must take pictures with their cellphones and manually transfer them to an office computer to create or update records. For this reason, they require an interface that we called Warehouse app. It would be a smoother interface and optimized for use on smaller, more portable devices like a smartphone.
